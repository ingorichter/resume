    "summary": "I am an experienced agile software engineer with a proven track record of delivering innovative open source and closed source products on Windows, macOS, and iOS. I actively code in c/c++, Objective-C, and JavaScript/node.js on Windows and macOS. I am an expert in software delivery automation and advocate for CI/CD. I have used Jenkins/Huson for 8+ years to help teams getting their software built. I enjoy learning new languages and tools. I spent the time to improve my knowledge on Go, Swift, and Kotlin. I used Docker to run a Bot on my Raspberry Pi. I delivered high-quality and innovative products like Brackets, Edge Code, Adobe Photoshop Device Preview, Adobe Creative Suite, Flash Catalyst and Adobe Experience Design (aka Adobe XD).",
